# Volatility Prediction of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index Based on LSTM

Forecasting volatility of stock market has always been the emphasis of research due to the benefits for both investors and the market. In this project, I crawled Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and Baidu Index in the past 10 years using Python. In the model, I incorporated public focus on microeconomics with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and predicted the stock volatility in China, and evaluated model performance and measured forecast deviation based on RMSE and MAPE.
