# Overview

###  1. Volatility Prediction of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index Based on LSTM (LSTM.pdf) 
*Jun 2021*

The *LSTM.pdf* is the write up of the final project for Deep Learning. Forecasting volatility of stock market has always been the emphasis of research due to the benefits for both investors and the market. In this project, I crawled Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and Baidu Index in the past 10 years using Python. In the model, I incorporated public focus on microeconomics with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and predicted the stock volatility in China, and evaluated model performance and measured forecast deviation based on RMSE and MAPE.

### 2. Influence of Tourist Number on Water Quality (NUS_waterquality.pdf)
*Jan 2021 - Feb 2021*

The *NUS_waterquality.pdf* is the report of a winter group project in National University of Singapore (NUS). We, as a 9-member team, collected and cleaned the data regarding visitor numbers and E.coli level and built a linear regression model in R. I am so honored that our team attained the best team in the project.
